MORTGAGE-API üè†
</h1>
<p align="center">
 <em>REST API that allows to calculate mortgage details, such as payment schedule and principal/interest breakdown. 
Supports addition of extra payments - they will be dynamically incorporated into the payment schedule.</em></p>

---
## Basic info
An annuity repayment scheme is used for calculations. 
The formula for calculating a monthly payment: 
```
PAYMENT = LOAN AMOUNT * (INTEREST RATE / (1 + INTEREST RATE) - NUMBER OF MONTHS - 1)
```
The final payment may be less than the standard monthly payment, so the amount of the final payment is equal to the 
remaining balance after the previous payment was made.
## Run
You can run the app natively:
```shell
pip install poetry
poetry install
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```
Or via docker-compose:
```shell
docker-compose run app python manage.py migrate
docker-compose up
```
## Quickstart
1. Create a user:<br><b>POST</b> `127.0.0.1:8000/auth/register/`
```json
{
    "username": "admin",
    "password": "adminadmin",
    "password2": "adminadmin",
    "email": "admin@example.com"
}
```
2. Get a token:<br><b>POST</b> `127.0.0.1:8000/auth/token/`
```json
{
    "username": "admin",
    "password": "adminadmin"
}
```
3. Create a mortgage:<br><b>POST</b> `127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/mortgage/`<br><em>headers: {Authorization: Bearer <your_token_value>}</em>
```json
{
    "percent": "8.20",
    "period": 25,
    "first_payment_amount": 2500000,
    "total_amount": 11000000,
    "issue_date": "2021-09-04"
}
```
4. Calculate mortgage schedule: <br><b>POST</b> `127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/mortgage/<mortgage_id>/calc-payment-schedule/`<br><em>headers: {Authorization: Bearer <your_token_value>}</em>
5. Add extra payment: <br><b>POST</b> `127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/mortgage/<mortgage_id>/add-extra-payment/`<br><em>headers: {Authorization: Bearer <your_token_value>}</em>
```json
{
    "amount": 70000,
    "date": "2021-10-04"
}
```
6. Check calculated payments: <br><b>GET</b> `127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/mortgage/<mortgage_id>/payment/?page_size=100&page=1`<br><em>headers: {Authorization: Bearer <your_token_value>}</em>
## API structure
Use Swagger to see all endpoints description: [127.0.0.1:8000/swagger/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/swagger/)
## ‚ö†Ô∏è Usage
* All `mortgage/` endpoints are available only for registered users.
* User can only see mortgages that were created by himself.
* After updating a mortgage (PUT, PATCH), payment schedule will be recalculated automatically. Also, all extra payments for this mortgage will be removed.
* You can't CRUD payments directly via API - use `calc-payment-schedule/` endpoint instead.
* There are a few rules for adding extra payments `add-extra-payment/`:
   - Extra payment's date should be bigger than first payment's date and lower than last payment's date.
   - Extra payment's amount should be less than previous payment's debt rest.
* Access token expires in 1 hour, refresh token - in 24 hours. Use `token/refresh/` to refresh the token.
## Logging
The app writes logs to a console and to a file named `mortgage_api.log` in (if it's not `prod` env) the app's base directory.
This file contains events in json representation which is easy to be parsed.
You can go to the `settings.py` and remove `file` handler in `LOGGING` section if it feels redundant.
Besides default Django events all payment calculations are logged. 
## Pre-commit hooks
Make sure you did install requirements (`pip install -r requirements.txt`) and then just set up the git hook scripts via `pre-commit`:
```shell
pre-commit install
```
