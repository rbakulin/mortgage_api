## API structure
Use Swagger to see all endpoints description: `127.0.0.1:8000/swagger/`
## ‚ö†Ô∏è Usage
* All `mortgage/` endpoints are available only for registered users.
* User can only see mortgages that were created by himself.
* After updating a mortgage (PUT, PATCH), payment schedule will be recalculated automatically. Also, all extra payments for this mortgage will be removed.
* You can't CRUD payments directly via API - use `calc-payment-schedule/` endpoint instead.
* There are a few rules for adding extra payments `add-extra-payment/`:
   - Extra payment's date should be bigger than first payment's date and lower than last payment's date.
   - Extra payment's amount should be less than previous payment's debt rest.
* Access token expires in 1 hour, refresh token - in 24 hours. Use `token/refresh/` to refresh the token.
## Pre-commit hooks
* Make sure you did install requirements (`pip install -r requirements.txt`), and then just set up the git hook scripts via `pre-commit`:
```shell
pre-commit install
```
